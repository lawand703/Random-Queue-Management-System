Welcome to the Random Queue Management System project! This project simulates a queue management system where customers arrive randomly and are placed in the queue based on certain conditions.

- **Add Customer at the End**: Add a customer to the end of the queue.
- **Insert Customer in the Middle**: Insert a customer at a specified position in the queue.
- **Print Queue**: Display the current queue.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Compile the source code using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable file.

## Simulation

The program simulates the arrival of customers, each assigned a random number from 1 to 3, representing different conditions:

- **2**: Customer joins the end of the queue.
- **3**: Customer joins the beginning of the queue.
